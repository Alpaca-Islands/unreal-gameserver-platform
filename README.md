# Unreal Gamserver Platform
this is a modified image from https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/SharingAndReleasing/Containers/ContainersQuickStart/ to run unreal engine gameservers
## Why
This image is for running windows servers from unreal engine games like ARK:SE to run in a headless enviroment.
I made this because i wanted to dockerize an ARK:SE server in an windows images so it is compatible with arkserverapi

## info
All these images do is add some dlls to the container and done
Most of them are directx opengl etc.
